# Abstract

This project is based on the data set and statistical concepts introduced in Chapter 6, **Linear Model Selection and Regularization**, from "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" (by James et al.). The primary objective is to perform mulitple predictive modeling processes applied to the data set *Credit*, as well as learn about the relationship between `Balance` and the rest of the quantitative and qualitative variables. The five models considered are *Ordinary Least Squares*, *Ridge Regression (RR)*, *Lasso Regression (LR)*, *Principal Components Regression (PCR)*, and *Partial Least Squares REgression (PLSR)*. Using cross-validation, the most ideal model is evaluated from their respective Minimum Square Errors on the test sets.
