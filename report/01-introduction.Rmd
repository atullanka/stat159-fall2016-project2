# Introduction

The primary purpose of this report is to determine the best model for predicting `Balance` given the ten different predictors, both quantitative and qualitative from the *Credit* data set. The distributions of these variables will be examined through summaries and plots, and five aforementioned regression models will be applied to the data (*Ridge Regression (RR)*, *Lasso Regression (LR)*, *Principal Components Regression (PCR)*, and *Partial Least Squares REgression (PLSR)*). The means of comparing and analyzing five models will be by studying their respective coefficients and  mean squared errors (MSE) calculated from the 10-fold cross-validation. 

We will discuss our data, methods, analysis, and our main conclusions throughout this paper. These sections will also include diagrams such as tables and graphs to help the reader gain a better understanding of our data and to visualize the outcomes of the different methods.
